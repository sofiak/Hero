## 1.
I spent about 16 hours on the coding test.

## 2.
With more time I would have
* improved the design
* used redux for managing state
* added some more functionality like filtering favorites.
* refactored and cleaned up the code

## 3.
Being a graduate developer, I have not debugged in production before.

But I would try to use different tools to measure load times and single out bottle necks, and then refactor to improve the performance. Would also try to use error logging tools like Bugsnag.
